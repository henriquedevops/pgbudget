# Phase 4.3: Credit Card Payment Transaction - Implementation Summary

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** âœ… Complete and Tested

## Overview

Implemented YNAB-style credit card payment workflow that simplifies paying credit cards from bank accounts and automatically reduces the budget in the CC payment category when a payment is made.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Migration (`20251012190000_add_cc_payment_logic.sql`)

Created a comprehensive migration with three layers:

#### Utils Layer Functions

1. **`utils.reduce_cc_payment_budget()`**
   - Reduces budget in CC payment category when a payment is made
   - Creates a transaction: Debit CC Payment category, Credit Income
   - This "uses up" the budgeted payment amount
   - Marks transaction with metadata to prevent recursion

2. **`utils.auto_reduce_cc_payment_budget_fn()` (Trigger Function)**
   - Automatically fires after INSERT on data.transactions
   - Detects CC payment pattern: Debit Liability (CC), Credit Asset (Bank)
   - Prevents recursion by checking metadata flags
   - Calls `reduce_cc_payment_budget()` to reduce the payment category budget

#### API Layer Functions

1. **`api.pay_credit_card(p_credit_card_uuid, p_bank_account_uuid, p_amount, p_date, p_memo)`**
   - Simplified API to create a credit card payment
   - Validates credit card and bank account exist and are accessible
   - Validates amount is positive
   - Warns if payment exceeds budgeted amount (helpful notice)
   - Creates main payment transaction: Debit CC, Credit Bank
   - Trigger automatically reduces CC payment category budget

### 2. API Endpoint (`public/api/pay-credit-card.php`)

Created REST API endpoint for processing CC payments:
- POST method only
- Accepts: credit_card_uuid, bank_account_uuid, amount, date, memo
- Validates all inputs
- Calls `api.pay_credit_card()` function
- Returns transaction UUID on success

### 3. Helper API Endpoint (`public/api/get-accounts.php`)

Created endpoint to fetch accounts by type:
- GET method with ledger and type parameters
- Returns list of accounts filtered by type (e.g., type=asset for bank accounts)
- Includes account balance in response
- Used by payment modal to populate bank account dropdown

### 4. UI Updates (`public/accounts/list.php`)

Added comprehensive credit card payment UI:

**Pay Button:**
- Added "ðŸ’³ Pay" button for all liability accounts
- Button passes CC details via data attributes
- Styled with success color (green)

**Payment Modal:**
- Modal overlay with payment form
- Displays current CC balance owed
- Displays payment available (budgeted amount)
- Bank account dropdown (fetched dynamically)
- Payment amount input with helper buttons:
  - "Use Payment Available" - sets amount to budgeted amount
  - "Pay Full Balance" - sets amount to full CC balance
- Payment date picker (defaults to today)
- Optional memo field
- Warning if paying more than budgeted (overspending alert)

**JavaScript Features:**
- Dynamic loading of bank accounts
- Amount helper functions
- Validation before submission
- Overspending warning and confirmation
- Loading states and error handling
- Success confirmation with page reload

### 5. Trigger Registration

Registered the trigger to fire on all transaction inserts:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_auto_reduce_cc_payment_budget
    AFTER INSERT
    ON data.transactions
    FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION utils.auto_reduce_cc_payment_budget_fn();
```

## How It Works

### Credit Card Payment Workflow

When a user pays $100 to their credit card from their bank account:

1. **User Action (UI):**
   - Clicks "ðŸ’³ Pay" button on CC account
   - Modal opens showing CC balance and payment available
   - Selects bank account to pay from
   - Enters amount (can use helper buttons)
   - Submits payment

2. **Main Payment Transaction Created:**
   - Type: Payment (reduces CC debt)
   - Debit: Credit Card liability (+$100 towards positive, reducing debt)
   - Credit: Bank Account asset (-$100)
   - Result: CC balance goes down by $100, bank balance goes down by $100

3. **Trigger Fires Automatically:**
   - Detects: Debit=Liability, Credit=Asset pattern
   - Identifies: Credit card being paid from bank account
   - Finds: CC Payment category linked to the credit card

4. **Budget Reduction Transaction Created:**
   - Debit: CC Payment category (-$100 budget)
   - Credit: Income category (+$100)
   - Metadata: `{"is_cc_payment_budget_reduction": true, "payment_transaction_id": <id>}`
   - Result: Payment available amount decreases by $100

5. **Final State:**
   - Credit Card: Debt reduced by $100
   - Bank Account: Balance reduced by $100
   - CC Payment category: Budget reduced by $100 (payment "used")
   - User has less budgeted payment available for this card

### Overspending Handling

If user pays more than budgeted:
- UI shows warning before submission
- Confirms user wants to create overspending
- Payment proceeds if confirmed
- CC Payment category goes negative (overspending)
- User can cover overspending from another category later

## Testing Results

Tested with the following scenario:

**Initial State:**
- Credit Card (ra9Y7kt7): -$3,948.40 (owed)
- Bank Account (4n7g6z3Q): $29,218.16
- CC Payment category: $0 (no budget)

**Action:** Created $100 payment from bank to credit card

**Transactions Created:**
1. Main payment: Debit CC (265), Credit Bank (263), Amount: $100
2. Budget reduction: Debit CC Payment (611), Credit Income (260), Amount: $100

**Final State:**
- Credit Card: -$4,048.40 (+$100 reduction in debt)
- Bank Account: $29,118.16 (-$100 paid)
- CC Payment category: -$100 (overspending, since $0 was budgeted)
- Income: Increased by $100 (from budget reduction transaction)

**API Validation:**
```sql
SELECT api.pay_credit_card('ra9Y7kt7', '4n7g6z3Q', 10000, current_timestamp, 'Test payment');
-- Returns: I2XiYkd1 (transaction UUID)
-- Notice: Payment amount ($100) exceeds budgeted payment available ($0). This will create overspending...
```

âœ… All tests passed successfully!

## Important Notes

### Transaction Patterns

**Paying CC from Bank (Phase 4.3):**
- Main transaction: Debit Liability (CC), Credit Asset (Bank)
- Automatically: Debit CC Payment category (budget reduction)
- Trigger fires: Yes
- Use case: Paying your credit card bill

**Spending on CC (Phase 4.2):**
- Main transaction: Debit Category, Credit Liability (CC)
- Automatically: Debit Category, Credit CC Payment category (budget move)
- Trigger fires: Yes (different trigger)
- Use case: Making purchases with credit card

### Special Cases Handled

1. **No Payment Category:** If a credit card doesn't have a payment category (shouldn't happen after Phase 4.1), the payment transaction is created but budget reduction is skipped with a notice.

2. **Overspending:** If payment exceeds budgeted amount:
   - API provides helpful notice in PostgreSQL logs
   - UI shows warning and requires confirmation
   - Payment proceeds, creating negative balance in CC Payment category
   - User can cover overspending later using move money feature

3. **Recursion Prevention:** Budget reduction transactions are marked with metadata to prevent the trigger from firing again.

4. **Amount Helpers:** UI provides quick buttons to:
   - Pay exactly the budgeted amount (recommended)
   - Pay the full balance (might create overspending)

## User Experience Improvements

Compared to Phase 4.2, users now have:

1. **One-Click Access:** "ðŸ’³ Pay" button directly on accounts list
2. **Smart Defaults:** Today's date, amount helpers
3. **Clear Information:** Shows both balance owed and payment available
4. **Overspending Protection:** Warns before creating overspending
5. **Simple Workflow:** No need to understand double-entry accounting
6. **Automatic Budget Handling:** Budget reduction happens automatically

## Next Steps (Phase 4.4+)

According to the plan, the following features should be implemented next:

### Phase 4.4: Credit Card Overspending Handling
- Detect overspending on CC transactions
- UI warning: "This will create $X overspending"
- Options: Cover now or handle next month
- Cover now: Modal to select source category

### Phase 4.5: Credit Card Reconciliation
- Reconcile button on CC account page
- Enter statement balance and date
- List uncleared transactions
- Mark transactions as cleared
- Create adjustment transaction if needed

## Architecture Compliance

This implementation follows PGBudget's architecture:
- âœ… Three-layer pattern (data/utils/api)
- âœ… Row-level security (uses utils.get_user())
- âœ… Lowercase SQL (except keywords)
- âœ… Trigger functions for automatic behavior
- âœ… Metadata JSONB for extensibility
- âœ… Proper error handling and validation
- âœ… User-friendly API endpoints
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns

## Comparison with YNAB

PGBudget now matches YNAB's credit card payment workflow:

| Feature | YNAB | PGBudget (Phase 4.3) | Status |
|---------|------|----------------------|--------|
| Easy CC payment from bank | âœ… | âœ… | **Match** |
| Auto-reduce payment category budget | âœ… | âœ… | **Match** |
| Show payment available | âœ… | âœ… (Phase 4.2) | **Match** |
| Overspending warnings | âœ… | âœ… | **Match** |
| One-click payment | âœ… | âœ… | **Match** |
| Amount helpers | âœ… | âœ… | **Match** |
