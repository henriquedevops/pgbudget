# Onboarding System Implementation

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Feature:** Welcome & Onboarding Flow (Phase 1.1 from USABILITY_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive 5-step onboarding wizard that guides new users through setting up their first budget in PGBudget. This addresses the critical gap identified in the usability analysis where users were immediately dropped into the technical interface with no guidance.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Migration)
**File:** `migrations/20251027025238_add_onboarding_system.sql`

- Added onboarding tracking columns to `data.users` table:
  - `onboarding_completed` (boolean)
  - `onboarding_step` (integer)
  - `registered_at` (timestamp)

- Created `data.budget_templates` table with 3 pre-configured templates:
  - Single Person Starter
  - Family Budget
  - Student Budget

- Added API functions:
  - `api.apply_budget_template()` - Apply a template to a ledger
  - `api.complete_onboarding_step()` - Track step progression
  - `api.skip_onboarding()` - Allow experienced users to skip

### 2. Onboarding Wizard Pages

**Main Controller:** `public/onboarding/wizard.php`
- Manages step progression
- Shows progress indicator
- Handles step validation

**Step 1:** `public/onboarding/step1.php` - Welcome
- Friendly introduction
- Feature highlights
- Option to skip for experienced users

**Step 2:** `public/onboarding/step2.php` - Philosophy
- Introduces the 4 budgeting principles:
  1. Give every dollar a job
  2. Only budget money you actually have
  3. Adapt when life happens
  4. Break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle

**Step 3:** `public/onboarding/step3.php` - Create Budget
- Simple form to name the budget
- Optional description field
- Creates ledger via API

**Step 4:** `public/onboarding/step4.php` - Add First Account
- Visual account type selector (Checking, Savings, Cash, Other)
- Account name and initial balance
- Creates asset account via API

**Step 5:** `public/onboarding/step5.php` - Quick Start Categories
- Template selection with visual cards
- Shows preview of categories in each template
- Option for custom (no template)
- Applies template and completes onboarding

### 3. Styling
**File:** `public/css/onboarding.css`

- Modern, friendly design with gradients and animations
- Progress bar with smooth transitions
- Card-based layouts for options
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Consistent color scheme (purple/blue gradient)
- Hover effects and visual feedback

### 4. JavaScript
**File:** `public/js/onboarding.js`

- `completeStep()` - API call to save progress
- Form validation helpers
- Auto-focus on inputs
- Prevent accidental navigation
- Error/success message handling

### 5. API Endpoints

**`public/api/onboarding/complete-step.php`**
- POST endpoint to mark a step as complete
- Updates user's onboarding progress

**`public/api/onboarding/skip.php`**
- POST endpoint to skip entire onboarding
- Marks user as completed

**`public/api/onboarding/templates.php`**
- GET endpoint to fetch available templates
- Returns template details and categories

**`public/api/onboarding/apply-template.php`**
- POST endpoint to apply a template to a ledger
- Creates category groups and categories

### 6. Integration
**File:** `public/index.php` (Modified)

- Checks user's onboarding status on login
- Redirects to wizard if not completed
- Shows success message after completion
- Updated "Create First Budget" link to point to onboarding

## User Flow

```
1. User logs in for first time
   ↓
2. System checks onboarding_completed flag
   ↓
3. If false → Redirect to /onboarding/wizard.php?step=1
   ↓
4. User progresses through 5 steps:
   - Welcome & Introduction
   - Learn budgeting philosophy
   - Create budget (ledger)
   - Add first account
   - Choose category template
   ↓
5. System marks onboarding_completed = true
   ↓
6. Redirect to dashboard with success message
   ↓
7. User can start budgeting immediately
```

## Technical Details

## Files Modified

```
public/
  └── index.php (added onboarding check and redirect)
```

## Success Metrics

**Target:** 80% onboarding completion rate

**Measure:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE onboarding_completed = TRUE) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as completion_rate
FROM data.users
WHERE registered_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

**Additional Metrics:**
- Average time to complete: Target <5 minutes
- Drop-off rate per step
- Template selection distribution
- User retention after onboarding

## Next Steps

From USABILITY_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md, the next priorities are:

1. **Language Simplification** (Phase 2.1)
   - Replace technical terms with user-friendly language
   - Add tooltips throughout the interface

2. **Quick Add Transaction** (Phase 4.1)
   - Modal-based transaction entry
   - Accessible from anywhere

3. **Dashboard Redesign** (Phase 3.1)
   - Visual enhancements
   - Better information hierarchy

## Notes

- The onboarding system is fully functional but requires the migration to be run
- Templates can be customized by editing the migration file
- Additional templates can be added via INSERT statements
- The wizard is extensible - new steps can be added easily
- All text is easily customizable for different audiences
