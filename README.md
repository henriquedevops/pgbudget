## Ledger creation side effects

When creating a new Ledger, we need to create three internal accounts:
- Income (Equity)
- Off-budget (Equity)
- Unassigned (Equity)

These accounts are used for organizing purposes, so every transaction is accounted for, even when we don’t have all the information on hand. If we spend money on something that we don’t have a category for, and we need to enter it into our system, we assign the destination account (category) of Unassigned.
