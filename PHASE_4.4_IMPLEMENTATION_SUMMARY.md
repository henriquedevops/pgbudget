# Phase 4.4: Credit Card Overspending Handling - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** âœ… Complete

## Overview

Implemented YNAB-style overspending detection and handling to help users manage categories that have gone over budget. This feature helps users understand when they've overspent and provides a simple workflow to cover overspending by moving budget from other categories.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Layer (Migration: `20251012200000_add_overspending_handling.sql`)

#### Utils Functions
- **`utils.get_overspent_categories(ledger_id, user_data)`**
  - Returns all categories with negative balances (overspent)
  - Excludes special accounts (Income, Unassigned, Off-budget)
  - Returns overspent amount as positive number
  - Location: migrations/20251012200000_add_overspending_handling.sql:26-51

- **`utils.cover_overspending(overspent_category_id, source_category_id, amount, ledger_id, user_data)`**
  - Moves budget from source category to overspent category
  - Validates source has sufficient budget
  - Creates transaction with metadata marking it as cover operation
  - Returns transaction ID
  - Location: migrations/20251012200000_add_overspending_handling.sql:64-126

#### API Functions
- **`api.get_overspent_categories(ledger_uuid)`**
  - API wrapper for getting overspent categories
  - Uses RLS for security
  - Returns category UUID, name, and overspent amount
  - Location: migrations/20251012200000_add_overspending_handling.sql:139-176

- **`api.cover_overspending(overspent_category_uuid, source_category_uuid, amount?)`**
  - API wrapper to cover overspending
  - Amount is optional - defaults to full overspent amount
  - Validates categories exist and are accessible
  - Returns transaction UUID
  - Location: migrations/20251012200000_add_overspending_handling.sql:188-267

### 2. API Endpoint (`public/api/cover-overspending.php`)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/cover-overspending.php?ledger={uuid}`
  - Returns list of overspent categories
  - Response format:
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "overspent_categories": [
        {
          "category_uuid": "abc123",
          "category_name": "Groceries",
          "overspent_amount": 2500
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## User Workflow

### Scenario 1: User Notices Overspending on Dashboard

1. User logs into budget dashboard
2. Red warning banner appears at top: "You have 2 overspent categories"
3. User clicks "Cover Overspending" button in banner
4. Modal opens showing first overspent category
5. User selects source category from dropdown (only shows categories with available budget)
6. Visual preview shows: "Groceries â†’ Dining Out ($25.00)"
7. User clicks "Cover Overspending"
8. Success message appears
9. Page reloads showing updated balances
10. Warning banner disappears if no more overspending

### Scenario 2: User Covers Specific Overspent Category

1. User browses budget categories table
2. "Dining Out" category shows negative balance in red
3. Row has red left border and pink background
4. User sees "ðŸ©¹ Cover" button in actions column
5. User clicks "Cover" button
6. Modal opens pre-populated with "Dining Out" category
7. Shows overspent amount: $25.00
8. User selects "Entertainment" as source (shows "$150.00 available")
9. Visual preview updates automatically
10. User submits form
11. Budget is adjusted instantly
12. Category balance returns to zero or positive

### Scenario 3: Partial Cover

1. User has $50 overspending in "Groceries"
2. Opens cover modal
3. Only wants to cover $30 now
4. Enters "30.00" in amount field
5. Visual preview shows $30.00 movement
6. Submits form
7. "Groceries" now shows -$20 (improved from -$50)
8. Can cover remaining $20 later

## Technical Details

### Data Flow

```
User Action (Click Cover)
    â†“
JavaScript Modal Opens
    â†“
Load Categories from DOM (budget_status)
    â†“
User Selects Source & Submits
    â†“
POST /api/cover-overspending.php
    â†“
api.cover_overspending(overspent_uuid, source_uuid, amount?)
    â†“
utils.cover_overspending(ids, amount, ledger_id, user)
    â†“
Validate source has sufficient budget
    â†“
Create Transaction (Debit source, Credit overspent)
    â†“
Add metadata: is_cover_overspending = true
    â†“
Return transaction UUID
    â†“
Page Reloads
    â†“
Updated balances displayed
```

### Transaction Metadata

Covering transactions include special metadata:
```json
{
  "is_cover_overspending": true,
  "overspent_category_id": 123,
  "source_category_id": 456
}
```

This allows:
- Identifying cover transactions in transaction history
- Future reporting on budget adjustments
- Potential undo functionality

### Security

- All API calls require authentication (via `requireAuth()`)
- User context set via PostgreSQL session variables
- Row-level security enforced on all database operations
- Functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` with proper RLS checks
- User can only cover overspending in their own ledgers
- Input validation on all parameters

## Styling

### Color Scheme
- **Overspending Warning Banner:** Red gradient (#fc8181 to #f56565)
- **Overspent Rows:** Pink background (#fff5f5) with red left border (#fc8181)
- **Cover Button:** Red background (#f56565) â†’ darker on hover (#e53e3e)
- **Success State:** Green (#38a169)
- **Visual Summary:** Light blue background (#f7fafc)

### Responsive Design
- Desktop: Full modal with side-by-side layout
- Tablet: Adjusted spacing and font sizes
- Mobile: Stacked layout, full-width buttons
- Warning banner adjusts from horizontal to vertical on small screens

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 4.4.1: Next Month Handling
- Option to subtract overspending from next month's budget
- Track overspending across month boundaries
- "Handle Next Month" option in modal

### Phase 4.4.2: Credit Card Integration
- When spending on credit card creates overspending
- Prompt: "Cover now or handle next month?"
- Link to CC Payment category workflow

### Phase 4.4.3: Overspending Reports
- Track overspending frequency per category
- Report on budget adjustment patterns
- Suggest budget increases for frequently overspent categories

### Phase 4.4.4: Undo Cover Operation
- Undo button in success message
- Reverse transaction within 30 seconds
- Restore previous balances

## Documentation

- Inline code comments throughout
- JSDoc-style comments for JavaScript functions
- SQL function comments using `COMMENT ON FUNCTION`
- Clear variable and function names
- This implementation summary

## Conclusion

Phase 4.4 successfully implements comprehensive overspending handling that:
1. **Detects** overspending automatically
2. **Alerts** users with clear visual warnings
3. **Educates** users about what overspending means
4. **Guides** users through the cover process
5. **Executes** budget adjustments safely
6. **Confirms** successful resolution

The implementation follows PGBudget's established patterns, maintains security through RLS, and provides a user experience comparable to YNAB's overspending workflow.

**Ready for:** User testing and feedback collection
**Next Phase:** Phase 4.5 - Credit Card Reconciliation
