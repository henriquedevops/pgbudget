## User Workflow

### Scenario 1: Reconciling a Checking Account

1. User navigates to Accounts page
2. Clicks "⚖️ Reconcile" button next to their checking account
3. Sees current PGBudget balance: $1,523.45
4. Looks at bank statement showing balance: $1,500.00
5. Enters statement date (Oct 12, 2025) and balance ($1,500.00)
6. Summary appears showing $23.45 difference
7. Clicks "Load Uncleared Transactions"
8. Sees list of 12 uncleared transactions
9. Checks off 10 transactions that appear on statement
10. Leaves 2 pending transactions unchecked
11. Clicks "Complete Reconciliation"
12. System marks 10 transactions as reconciled
13. System creates $23.45 adjustment transaction (Unassigned → Checking)
14. Success notification appears
15. Page reloads showing reconciliation in history table
16. Account balance now matches statement exactly

### Scenario 2: Reconciling Credit Card

1. User has credit card with balance of -$845.23 (owed)
2. Credit card statement shows balance of -$845.23
3. Enters statement info
4. Summary shows "Perfect! Your balances match exactly."
5. Loads 8 uncleared transactions
6. Selects all transactions using "Select All" button
7. Completes reconciliation
8. All 8 transactions marked as reconciled
9. No adjustment needed
10. Reconciliation recorded in history

### Scenario 3: Finding Discrepancy

1. User's checking account shows $2,000 in PGBudget
2. Bank statement shows $1,950
3. Enters statement info, sees $50 difference
4. Loads transactions to investigate
5. Notices one $50 transaction that cleared but wasn't in PGBudget
6. Cancels reconciliation
7. Adds missing $50 transaction manually
8. Returns to reconciliation page
9. Now balances match
10. Completes reconciliation successfully

2. Calculate difference (statement - pgbudget)
3. Mark selected transactions as 'reconciled'
4. If difference ≠ 0:
   - Create adjustment transaction
   - Debit or Credit account as needed
   - Other side is Unassigned category
5. Create reconciliation record
6. Return reconciliation UUID
    ↓
JavaScript Shows Success
    ↓
Page Reloads with Updated History
```

### Adjustment Transaction Logic

When statement balance doesn't match PGBudget balance:

**Positive Difference** (Statement > PGBudget):
```sql
-- Account needs more money
-- Credit account (increase balance)
-- Debit Unassigned (decrease unassigned funds)
Transaction:
  Debit: Unassigned
  Credit: Account
  Amount: difference
```

**Negative Difference** (Statement < PGBudget):
```sql
-- Account has too much money
-- Debit account (decrease balance)
-- Credit Unassigned (increase unassigned funds)
Transaction:
  Debit: Account
  Credit: Unassigned
  Amount: abs(difference)
```

### Transaction Metadata

Adjustment transactions include special metadata:
```json
{
  "is_reconciliation_adjustment": true,
  "difference": 2345  // in cents
}
```

Allows:
- Identifying adjustment transactions in reports
- Understanding why adjustments were made
- Potential undo functionality in future

### Security

- All API calls require authentication (`requireAuth()`)
- User context set via PostgreSQL session variables
- RLS policies enforce data isolation
- Functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` with proper checks
- User can only reconcile accounts in their own ledgers
- Cannot toggle status of other users' transactions

### Performance

- Indexed `cleared_status` column for fast filtering
- Efficient queries using account_id
- Reconciliation history limited to relevant account
- AJAX loading prevents full page reloads
- Transaction list virtualization for large datasets (scrollable)
