# Enhanced Budget Dashboard (Phase 1.3)

## Overview

Phase 1.3 completes the core workflow improvements for pgbudget's budget dashboard, adding YNAB-level UX enhancements that make daily budgeting smooth and intuitive.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Sticky Header for Budget Totals ‚≠ê

**Purpose:** Keep critical budget information visible while scrolling through a long list of categories.

**Implementation:**
- Automatically creates a fixed header clone of the "Ready to Assign" banner
- Appears when user scrolls past the original banner
- Smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions
- Compact design optimized for sticky positioning
- Syncs with the original banner's state

**User Experience:**
- Users can always see how much money they have left to assign
- No need to scroll back to the top to check totals
- Especially useful for budgets with many categories

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// Activates after scrolling 150px past the banner
config.stickyHeaderThreshold: 150

// CSS classes:
.sticky-budget-header        // The cloned header
.sticky-budget-header.show-sticky  // When visible
```

---

### 2. Enhanced Color Coding System üé®

**Purpose:** Provide instant visual feedback on category status at a glance.

**Color Scheme:**
- üü¢ **Green**: Category has a positive balance (on track)
- üü° **Yellow**: Category balance is zero (fully spent or not budgeted)
- üî¥ **Red**: Category is overspent (negative balance)

**Visual Implementation:**
- Subtle background tints that don't overwhelm
- Stronger hover states for interactivity
- Red categories get a bold left border (4px)
- Works seamlessly with existing overspent styling

**CSS Classes:**
```css
.category-row.category-green   // Positive balance
.category-row.category-yellow  // Zero balance
.category-row.category-red     // Negative balance (overspent)
```

**Impact:**
- Users can immediately identify problem categories
- Makes budget scanning much faster
- Reduces cognitive load when reviewing budget status

### 3. Quick-Add Transaction Button ‚ö°

**Purpose:** Reduce friction for adding transactions from the budget dashboard.

**Features:**
- Prominent green "‚ö° Quick Add Transaction" button in header
- Keyboard shortcut: Press **T** to open modal from anywhere
- Modal overlay doesn't navigate away from budget page
- Pre-populated with today's date
- All essential fields in one compact form

**Modal Fields:**
- Transaction type (Expense/Income)
- Amount
- Description
- Account
- Category
- Date

**User Flow:**
1. User presses **T** or clicks "Quick Add" button
2. Modal opens with focus on description field
3. User fills in transaction details
4. On submit, redirects to full transaction form with pre-filled data
5. User can review and confirm or make adjustments

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// Keyboard shortcut
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 't' || e.key === 'T') {
        openQuickAddModal();
    }
});

// Modal ID
config.quickAddModalId: 'quick-add-transaction-modal'
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster transaction entry workflow
- Stays in context of budget dashboard
- Keyboard-friendly for power users
- Familiar modal pattern (like YNAB)

### 4. Overspending Warning Banner ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Purpose:** Alert users immediately when categories are overspent.

**Implementation:**
- Automatically appears when one or more categories have negative balances
- Prominent red gradient banner with warning icon
- Shows count of overspent categories
- "Review Categories" button scrolls to category list
- Animated slide-in for attention

**Banner Content:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Overspending Detected
You have X categories with negative balance. Consider covering the overspending from another category.
[Review Categories]
```

**Visual Design:**
- Red gradient background (#fc8181 to #f56565)
- White text for high contrast
- Slide-down animation on appearance
- Positioned after period selector, before budget totals

**CSS:**
```css
.overspending-warning-banner {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fc8181 0%, #f56565 100%);
    animation: slideInDown 0.5s ease-out;
}
```

### 5. Cover Overspending Functionality üîß

**Purpose:** Implement YNAB Rule 3 ("Roll With The Punches") - make it easy to cover overspending.

**Features:**

#### A. "Cover" Button on Overspent Categories
- Automatically added to each overspent category row
- Red "üîß Cover" button in actions column
- Disabled if no other categories have positive balances
- Click opens "Cover Overspending" modal

#### B. Cover Overspending Modal
**Shows:**
- Which category is overspent and by how much
- List of available categories to pull funds from
- Each category shows available balance
- Amount field pre-filled with overspent amount
- Explanation of what "covering" means

**User Flow:**
1. User clicks "üîß Cover" button on overspent category
2. Modal opens showing overspent amount
3. User selects source category (shows available balances)
4. User confirms amount to cover (default: full overspent amount)
5. System creates move transaction using existing move_money API
6. Page refreshes to show updated balances
7. Success notification confirms the cover

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// Uses existing move_money.php API endpoint
POST /api/move_money.php
{
    ledger_uuid: "...",
    from_category_uuid: "source-category",
    to_category_uuid: "overspent-category",
    amount: "50.00",
    description: "Cover overspending in Groceries"
}
```

**Modal Features:**
- Auto-populates source categories (filters to positive balance only)
- Shows available balance next to each category name
- Validates sufficient funds before submitting
- Prevents overspending the source category
- Clear help text explaining the concept

**Help Text in Modal:**
```
üí° About Covering Overspending
‚Ä¢ This moves budget from another category to cover the negative balance
‚Ä¢ Choose a category that has enough available balance
‚Ä¢ This follows YNAB Rule 3: "Roll With The Punches"
```

### Phase 1.1 (Inline Budget Assignment):
- Color coding applies to inline-edited categories
- Sticky header updates when inline edits change totals
- Quick-add complements inline editing for transactions

### Phase 1.2 (Move Money Between Categories):
- Cover overspending uses the same move_money API
- Shares modal design patterns and styling

### Existing Dashboard:
- Preserves all existing functionality
- Additive enhancements only (no breaking changes)
- Works with period selector and budget totals

## API Endpoints Used

### 1. Move Money (existing from Phase 1.2)
```
POST /api/move_money.php
```
**Used for:** Cover overspending functionality

**Request:**
```json
{
    "ledger_uuid": "WkJxi8aN",
    "from_category_uuid": "abc123",
    "to_category_uuid": "xyz789",
    "amount": "50.00",
    "date": "2025-10-04",

}
```

    "success": true,
    "message": "Moved $50.00 from Category A to Category B",
    "from_category": { /* updated category data */ },
    "to_category": { /* updated category data */ }
}
```

---

## Configuration Options

All configuration in `budget-dashboard-enhancements.js`:

```javascript
const config = {
    // Sticky header appears after scrolling this many pixels past banner
    stickyHeaderThreshold: 150,

    // Modal IDs
    quickAddModalId: 'quick-add-transaction-modal',
    coverOverspendingModalId: 'cover-overspending-modal'
};
```

---

## Browser Compatibility

**Tested and working in:**
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge 90+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 88+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+
- ‚úÖ Mobile Safari (iOS 14+)
- ‚úÖ Chrome Mobile (Android)

**Required Features:**
- CSS Grid (for form layouts)
- CSS Animations/Transitions
- Fetch API
- ES6 JavaScript (arrow functions, const/let, template literals)
- IntersectionObserver (for sticky header, with fallback)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations:
1. **Sticky header:** Uses CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated)
2. **Scroll handling:** Throttled to avoid excessive calculations
3. **Color coding:** Applied on init, not on every render
4. **Modal creation:** Dynamic DOM creation only when needed
5. **Event delegation:** Single listeners for multiple buttons

### Load Time Impact:
- JavaScript file: ~12KB (minified)
- Additional CSS: ~4KB
- No additional network requests
- No external dependencies

## Troubleshooting

- Verify `.ready-to-assign-banner` element exists

### Color coding not applying:
- Check if balance values are being parsed correctly
- Inspect `.category-balance` cells for correct data
- Verify `initializeColorCoding()` is being called

### Quick-add modal not opening:
- Check if `getAllAccounts()` and `getAllCategories()` return data
- Verify ledger UUID is in URL parameters
- Check for modal ID conflicts

### Cover overspending failing:
- Verify move_money.php API is working
- Check source category has sufficient balance
- Ensure ledger UUID is correct
- Review network tab for API errors
